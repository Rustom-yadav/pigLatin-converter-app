# 🐷 Pig Latin Converter (JavaScript Only)

A logic-centric **Pig Latin Converter** implemented purely in **JavaScript**, focused on transforming English words into Pig Latin using deterministic string-processing rules.

This project intentionally excludes UI layers to emphasize **algorithmic clarity, conditional logic, and reusable function design**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Convert words into Pig Latin format
- Handle consonant and vowel rules correctly
- Practice conditional branching and string slicing
- Deliver predictable, testable output

Clear rules. Clean logic. Zero noise.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Pure JavaScript implementation
- Handles:
  - Words starting with vowels
  - Words starting with consonant clusters
- Deterministic and reusable function
- Case-insensitive processing
- No DOM, no dependencies

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla)

No HTML. No CSS. Logic only.

---
